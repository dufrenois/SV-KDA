Description
===========

This MATLAB package implements the SVM formulation of the kernel discriminant analysis presented in "a Support vector machine formulation for linear and kernel discriminant analysis" by Franck Dufrenois and Khalide Jbilou.  The PDF file of the paper will be included soon.  

Installation
============

Simply place the collection of m-files in a directory that is in MATLAB's path.  To verify everything is working properly, execute the scripts listed in main folder.  You should be able to replicate the output shown in this file.
